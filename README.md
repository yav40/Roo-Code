## Local Setup & Development

1. **Clone** the repo:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/RooVetGit/Roo-Code.git
```

2. **Install dependencies**:

```sh
npm run install:all
```

3. **Start the webview (Vite/React app with HMR)**:

```sh
npm run dev
```

4. **Debug**:
   Press `F5` (or **Run** ‚Üí **Start Debugging**) in VSCode to open a new session with Roo Code loaded.

Changes to the webview will appear immediately. Changes to the core extension will require a restart of the extension host.

Alternatively you can build a .vsix and install it directly in VSCode:

```sh
npm run build
```

A `.vsix` file will appear in the `bin/` directory which can be installed with:

```sh
code --install-extension bin/roo-cline-<version>.vsix
```

We use [changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets) for versioning and publishing. Check our `CHANGELOG.md` for release notes.
